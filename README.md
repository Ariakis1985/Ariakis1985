### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Ariakis, I am Cuban. From an early age I felt attraction for electronics and computer science. I studied electronics and computer science at the Osvaldo Herrera Technological University, Havana, Cuba. I am currently attending the bootcamp Henry. I am passionate about computer science, it is a very diverse world, where creativity can reach infinite levels. I consider myself a responsible and disciplined person. I am very interested in working as a programmer and keep my knowledge about technologies updated. I like sports, movies, music, dancing is one of my favorite activities.
