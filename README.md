### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Ariakis, I am 37 years old, I am Cuban. I am currently living in Mexico. From an early age I felt attraction for electronics and computer science. I started the career of Electronics and Computer Science in 2001 and finished in 2005. Currently I am studying and almost finished the Bootcamp Henry, Argentina, Buenos Aires, as a fullstack developer. I have increased my knowledge and experience with the Javascript programming language and different libraries. I have done different projects using React, Redux, Axios, PostgreSQL, Html, CSS, API consumption, among others. I am very interested in developing myself as a programmer and expanding my work experience.
